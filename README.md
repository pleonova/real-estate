## Upload your own data

Redfin makes this pretty straightforward and all you need to do is download a csv. You can go to their support article [here](https://support.redfin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016476931-Downloading-Data-), but it is honestly just a few clicks. Just note that they have a limit on how far in data you can go and how much you can download in one go.
